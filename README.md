Module 6 Assignment Due Friday Sept. 28

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

# Weather Map Search - API 

## Description

This assignment focused on the integration of a linked API to draw data to our site, and then displaying that data based on our written functionality: searching a city name. In this case we linked a weather API to display based on a users specific city search, and then displayed that information as both the current weather and an upcoming 5 day forecast. 

Overall this project stressed the importance of linking an API, and then formatting the response to display on our web page. It taught me a lot about the overall functionality of a fetch and then displaying our fetched data on our web page. It also reinforced concepts about how to store search history and then display that information in an interactive way back to the user.
